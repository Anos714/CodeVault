## 📌 Project Overview

**CodeVault** is a developer productivity tool designed to solve the _“Déjà Code”_ problem — the frustration of knowing you’ve already written a piece of code but being unable to find it when you need it most.

Instead of digging through old GitHub repositories, random text files, or bookmarked StackOverflow answers, CodeVault provides a **centralized, syntax-aware, and searchable cloud library** for your personal code snippets.

---

## ❓ The Problem

Every developer encounters situations like:

- Forgetting a useful utility function written months ago
- Losing regex patterns, middleware logic, or configuration snippets
- Rewriting solutions that already exist somewhere else

Current solutions are fragmented and not optimized for code storage. Traditional note-taking apps lack syntax awareness and organization tailored for developers.

---

## 💡 The Solution

**CodeVault** treats code snippets as _first-class citizens_.

It is purpose-built for developers and focuses on:

- Writing code comfortably
- Organizing snippets intelligently
- Retrieving the right snippet instantly

---

## ✨ Planned Features

- 📝 **Native Coding Experience**  
  Monaco Editor (VS Code engine) for familiar editing, indentation, and formatting

- 🏷️ **Smart Tag-Based Organization**  
  Organize snippets using tags like `#auth`, `#regex`, `#react-hooks`

- 🔍 **Instant Search & Filtering**  
  Find snippets by title, tags, or keywords in milliseconds

- 🎨 **Syntax Highlighting**  
  Automatic language detection for clear and readable code

- 🔐 **Secure Authentication**  
  Private snippets protected with JWT-based authentication
